# Socket Security Skills Reference

You have additional SKILLs documented in directories containing a "SKILL.md" file.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| socket-dep-cleanup | Evaluate and remove a single unused dependency from your project. Searches the entire codebase for all usages (imports, requires, config refs, scripts, type packages, indirect usage), reports findings, and performs full removal with verification. |
| socket-dep-patch | Apply Socket's binary-level security patches without changing dependency versions. Uses socket-patch apply to fix vulnerabilities in-place, then verifies automated patching is configured so patches persist across installs. |
| socket-dep-replace | Replace a dependency with an alternative package, eliminate it via code rewrite, or use socket-optimize for optimized replacements. |
| socket-dep-upgrade | Use socket fix to find and update vulnerable dependencies, then fix any breaking changes in the codebase. Security-audited upgrades with automated code migration. |
| socket-fix | Fix dependency security issues — either scan and fix everything (requires /socket-scan), or target a single named package. Orchestrates /socket-dep-cleanup, /socket-dep-replace, /socket-dep-patch, and /socket-dep-upgrade as subskills. |
| socket-inspect | Research a package before you depend on it — pull every signal from Socket (scores, alerts, malware verdicts, CVEs, supply-chain risk), check the socket.dev package page, evaluate alternatives, and surface available Socket patches. |
| socket-scan | Run a dependency scan using the Socket CLI. Prompts unauthenticated users to log in or create a free account. If the user skips login, falls back to cdxgen with greatly reduced alert accuracy and poor SBOM accuracy. Authenticated users get temporary read-only scans by default (--tmp). Creates a persistent dashboard scan only when explicitly requested. Includes reachability analysis for enterprise customers and license compliance auditing. |
| socket-scan-setup | Set up prerequisites for Socket scanning — install the CLI, configure auth with the public demo token, and verify scan access. Use this before the first scan or when encountering auth errors. |
| socket-setup | Set up Socket — prompt for API key, install the CLI, authenticate, configure policies and tokens, set up CI/CD for firewall or patch modes across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and other systems. |

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read the SKILL.md file whenever the description of the skills matches the user intent, or may help accomplish their task.

## Skill Paths

Paths referenced within SKILL folders are relative to that SKILL. For example the scan `scripts/example.sh` would be referenced as `scan/scripts/example.sh`.
