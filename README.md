# Socket Security Skills

Socket Security Skills are definitions for dependency security tasks like vulnerability scanning, package review, patching, firewall configuration, and secure dependency updates. They follow the standardized [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format and are compatible with **40+ coding agent tools** including:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) — native skill/plugin support
- **Codex** (OpenAI) — Agent Skills standard + AGENTS.md fallback
- **Gemini CLI** (Google DeepMind) — extensions support
- **OpenCode** — skill directory support
- **Cursor** — plugin manifest support
- **VS Code Copilot / GitHub Copilot** — via AGENTS.md or Skills CLI
- **Windsurf** — via Skills CLI
- **Roo Code** — via Skills CLI
- **Any agent supporting the Agent Skills standard** — via `npx skills add`

If your agent isn't listed above but supports skills, extensions, or custom instructions, it can likely use these skills via the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh/) or the [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) fallback.

## How do Skills work?

In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) format, where each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file that Codex discovers from standard `.agents/skills` locations documented in the [Codex Skills guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/). Codex can also work with an `AGENTS.md` file. Google Gemini uses 'extensions' to define the instructions for your coding agent in a `gemini-extension.json` file. **This repo is compatible with all of them, and more!**

> [!TIP]
> If your agent doesn't support skills, you can use [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) directly as a fallback.

## Installation

Socket Security Skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and any agent supporting the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).

### Quick Install

Install skills using the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh/) (works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and 40+ agents):

```
npx skills add SocketDev/skills
```

To list available skills before installing:

```
npx skills add SocketDev/skills --list
```

### Claude Code

1. Register the repository as a plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add SocketDev/skills
```

2. To install a skill, run:

```
/plugin install <skill-name>@SocketDev/skills
```

For example:

```
/plugin install scan@SocketDev/skills
```

### Codex

1. Copy or symlink any skills you want to use from this repository's `skills/` directory into one of Codex's standard `.agents/skills` locations (for example, `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills` or `$HOME/.agents/skills`) as described in the [Codex Skills guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/).

2. Once a skill is available in one of those locations, Codex will discover it using the Agent Skills standard and load the `SKILL.md` instructions when it decides to use that skill or when you explicitly invoke it.

3. If your Codex setup still relies on `AGENTS.md`, you can use the generated [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) file in this repo as a fallback bundle of instructions.

### Gemini CLI

1. This repo includes `gemini-extension.json` to integrate with the Gemini CLI.

2. Install locally:

```
gemini extensions install . --consent
```

or use the GitHub URL:

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/SocketDev/skills.git --consent
```

3. See [Gemini CLI extensions docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/#installing-an-extension) for more help.

### Cursor

This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`

Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow.

For contributors, regenerate manifests with:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

### OpenCode

This repository includes an `.opencode/skills` directory that OpenCode discovers automatically.

1. Clone or install this repo into your project
2. OpenCode will discover skills from `.opencode/skills/`

Or manually copy skill folders into your project's `.opencode/skills/` directory.

### Other Agents (VS Code Copilot, Windsurf, Roo Code, etc.)

For any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard or custom instructions:

1. Use the Skills CLI (recommended):

```
npx skills add SocketDev/skills
```

2. Or manually copy the [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) file into your agent's instructions/context directory. This file contains a summary of all available skills and their locations.

3. Skills use the Socket CLI and Batch PURL API directly — no MCP server required.

## Skills

This repository contains security-focused skills for dependency management. You can also contribute your own skills to the repository.

<!-- BEGIN_SKILLS_TABLE -->
#### Setup

Install, authenticate, and configure Socket for your project.

| Name | Description | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `socket-setup` | Set up Socket — prompt for API key, install the CLI, authenticate, configure policies and tokens, set up CI/CD for firewall or patch modes across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and other systems. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-setup/SKILL.md) |

#### Analysis

Scan dependencies and inspect individual packages for security risks.

| Name | Description | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `socket-inspect` | Research a package before you depend on it — pull every signal from Socket (scores, alerts, malware verdicts, CVEs, supply-chain risk), check the socket.dev package page, evaluate alternatives, and surface available Socket patches. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-inspect/SKILL.md) |
| `socket-scan` | Run a full dependency scan using the Socket CLI. Creates a scan in the Socket dashboard, checks all dependencies for vulnerabilities and supply-chain risks, performs Tier 1 reachability analysis for enterprise customers, and provides license compliance auditing with SBOM generation. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-scan/SKILL.md) |

#### Fix

Holistic dependency repair — orchestrate cleanup, replacement, patching, and upgrades in a single phased workflow with individual subskills for each operation.

| Name | Description | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `socket-dep-cleanup` | Evaluate and remove a single unused dependency from your project. Searches the entire codebase for all usages (imports, requires, config refs, scripts, type packages, indirect usage), reports findings, and performs full removal with verification. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-fix/socket-dep-cleanup/SKILL.md) |
| `socket-dep-patch` | Apply Socket's binary-level security patches without changing dependency versions. Uses socket-patch apply to fix vulnerabilities in-place, then verifies automated patching is configured so patches persist across installs. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-fix/socket-dep-patch/SKILL.md) |
| `socket-dep-replace` | Replace a dependency with an alternative package, eliminate it via code rewrite, or use socket-optimize for optimized replacements. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-fix/socket-dep-replace/SKILL.md) |
| `socket-dep-upgrade` | Use socket fix to find and update vulnerable dependencies one at a time, then fix any breaking changes in the codebase. Security-audited upgrades with automated code migration. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-fix/socket-dep-upgrade/SKILL.md) |
| `socket-fix` | Fix dependency security issues — either scan and fix everything (requires /socket-scan), or target a single named package. Orchestrates /socket-dep-cleanup, /socket-dep-replace, /socket-dep-patch, and /socket-dep-upgrade as subskills. | [SKILL.md](skills/socket-fix/SKILL.md) |
