# Ecosystem Detection

How to detect which package ecosystems are present in a project.

## Automated Detection

Run the ecosystem detection helper:

```
npx tsx scripts/helpers/detect-ecosystems.ts [--dir <path>]
```

This outputs JSON listing all detected ecosystems and their manifest files.

## Manual Detection

Scan the project root for manifest and lock files:

| Ecosystem | Manifest Files |
|-----------|---------------|
| npm | `package.json` + `package-lock.json` |
| pnpm | `package.json` + `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| yarn | `package.json` + `yarn.lock` |
| PyPI | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `Pipfile` |
| Cargo | `Cargo.toml` |
| Bundler | `Gemfile` |
| Maven | `pom.xml` |
| NuGet | `*.csproj`, `packages.config` |
| Go | `go.mod` |

For npm, pnpm, and yarn: differentiate by which lock file is present. If multiple ecosystems exist, process each independently.
